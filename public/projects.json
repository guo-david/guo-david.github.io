      "description": "In this project, we developed a model for music generation using autoencoders and transformer mixture distribution models, implemented in TensorFlow. Building on techniques like variational autoencoders (VAEs) and transformers, our approach processes high-dimensional music data to create coherent compositions. By using a sliding window method and training the model on both diverse and classical music datasets, we aimed to capture melodic patterns effectively. While the model performs well at learning tonality, there are still challenges with rhythm and long-term structure. We're continuing to explore ways to enhance the modelâ€™s rhythmic coherence and overall musicality.",
